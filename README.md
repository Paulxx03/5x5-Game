# 5x5-Game
CEN 4020 Project 1


This project is a simple game that allows users to fill in a 5x5 grid
with the constraints that numbers must be placed consecutively and in order
to get points the number must be placed diagonal to the previous one.

The code is made up of three objects: SaveState, Logic, and Interface which handle their respective
components
This was done in Python version 3.14.0 on the Windows operating system

The command to compile this program is "python Ass1.py"
